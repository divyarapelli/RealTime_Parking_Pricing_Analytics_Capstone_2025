# 🚗 Real-Time Parking Pricing – Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone Project

## 👩‍💻 Project Overview
This project implements a real-time, demand-based dynamic pricing system for 14 urban parking spaces using live data streams processed with **Pathway**.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Pathway (for real-time stream processing)
- Bokeh (for visualizations)

## 📈 Models Implemented
### Model 1: Baseline Linear Model

### Model 2: Demand-Based Pricing

### Model 3 (Optional): Competitive Model
Considers neighboring parking lot prices based on geo-proximity.
